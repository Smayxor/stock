Update.   Just use Pydroid.   After getting the bot running, you will see a terminal window, in the top right is a settings button with optiions for Wakelock and Wifilock.
I have not figured out where to use a shell script to loop-repeat-execute of the script, so you would of have to manually Run the bot after /sudo update

***************** Or configure Termux, good luck.

The termux app instructions were an effort to avoid issues i had with android putting app/bot to sleep when screen is off.  Getting Termux to work is slightly complicated once u get to the Pillow stage

To make run on an Android phone, install app Pydroid and pip install discord.py requests colour.   Turn OFF battery saver features so apps arent being put to sleep.  Can also Enabled Developer Mode and enable Keep Phone Screen On While Charging
When running on a phone, you can change code so it is ALWAYS in serverMode = True

Using Termux is worth it if you follow instructions.  Maybe perform pkg commands before pip commands.  

Using Termux on phone.    These instructions an attempt to avoid pydroid stopping when ads pop up and screen is off 
copy ur bot code and the font.ttf file to the Alarms folder, and the apikey.json file.  Open keyboard settings and DISABLE all auto-complete stuff!!!
pkg full-upgrade      
pkg install python3
pkg install libjpeg-turbo
pkg install freetype
pkg install coreutils
pkg install nodejs
termux-setup-storage
npm install -g nodemon
pkg install zstd
pkg install python make wget termux-exec clang libjpeg-turbo freetype -y
pkg install build-essential clang make pkg-config

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install wheel 
pip3 install discord.py
pip3 install requests
pip3 install colour

****notes, i got lost trying to make Pillow work, this should be the correct command below
LDFLAGS="-L/system/lib/" CFLAGS="-I/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/include/" pip3 install Pillow
***Note: If you are using an aarch64 device, set the LDFLAGS flag to "-L/system/lib64/"

env INCLUDE="$PREFIX/include" LDFLAGS=" -lm" pip install Pillow

MATHLIB="m" pip install pandas
****the pandas takes a LONG time********
pkg install libxml2 
pkg install libxslt 
pkg install lxml
****yfinance might also take a long time*****
pip3 install yfinance
Go to phone settings, Apps and enable permission for Termux to access storage

********should be ready to run the bot
then any time u open termux u can run bot by
cd /storage/emulated/0/Alarms
python3 stock.py server
or   /storage/emulated/0/Alarms/python3 stock.py server


**** dont purge ur pip unless u mess up and need to reinstall stuff.  pip keeps a cache of failed installations
pip3 cache dir   <-- displays location to pip3 cache folder, cd there and clear it if u need to reinstall something
pip3 cache remove pillow
pip3 cache purge

*****this stuff keeps it on when screen is off
termux-wake-lock
termux-wake-unlock 
can be used to trigger a wakelock which causes Android not to go into deep sleep.
Since the default login shell is bash; it could be useful to call termux-wake-lock in your ~/.profile (or ~/.bash_profile where appropriate) and termux-wake-unlock in your ~/.bash_logout; for single session usage. 

suggestion edit bash files to auto-load bot
cd /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/etc
nano bash.bashrc
need to add these 2 lines below
termux-wake-lock
cd /storage/emulated/0/Alarms/
python3 stock.py server
Ctrl+O to save, Ctrl+X to exit.
exit <-- exit the terminal, reopen Termux to see if it works

***********************below is notes on getting pandas installed, for yfinance.  should not be needed. 
 im not reinstalling everything from scratch to confirm***********************
Remove all packages

$ pip freeze > unins && pip uninstall -y -r unins && rm unins

Find the path of the cache for pip...

$ pip cache dir

... and clean it

$ rm -rf /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.cache/pip

Follow the tuto

$ pkg install build-essential clang make pkg-config

$ curl -LO https://its-pointless.github.io/setup-pointless-repo.sh 
$ bash setup-pointless-repo.sh
MATHLIB="m" pip install pandas
$ pkg install numpy

$ pkg install scipy

Install Pandas

$ pip install pandas

#  Installing Pandas

# # 1: Using pip
# ** Note: *No output* will be shown on terminal **
# ** and you need to wait for 1-2 hours **
# ** depend on your phone's hardware **

export CFLAGS=" -Wno-deprecated-declarations -Wno-unreachable-code" 
export LDFLAGS=" -lm -lcompiler_rt"
pip install pandas

#  # 2: Download source code and compile it by yourself
# There will be a LOT of outputs on your terminal so you
# will get a general idea how things went
# it's more comforting sometimes

cd $PREFIX/lib/python3.9/site-packages/
git clone https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas.git
cd pandas
export CFLAGS=" -Wno-deprecated-declarations -Wno-unreachable-code" 
export LDFLAGS=" -lm -lcompiler_rt"
make
# Now take a nap
# Do not delete the source code folder after you're done

# By the way
# if you failed installing pyzmq, type: CC=clang && pip install pyzmq
